# iPodOS18
Custom iPod theme for iPod nano 7G. Ipsw and custom images included in the release. Updates might be released in the future.
To install all you need to do is restore your iPod in iTunes with the custom ipsw. A guide is at the end of original Github repo.
The original project that made this possible is here (https://github.com/nfzerox/ipod_theme)
